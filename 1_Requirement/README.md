#Requirement

•	High level Requirements

	ATMEGA 328 microcontroller
	5v-10v voltage  supply
	LED’s
	Push switches

•	Low level Requirements

	SimulIde
	Codeblocks with Avr Gcc compiler
	Relays
	Resistors

•	SWOT ANALYSIS

	Strengths: 1. It is Easy to use.
               2. Automated project for wide application
               3. Low cost and compatible

	Weakness: 1. Project is about direction control but it is sometimes needed that both direction and speed control are required for wider applications.

	Opportunities: It is used at homes, industries, automation,automotive and elevators, Robotics etc.

	Threats: NA

•	4 W’S & 1 H
              
	WHO: The industries and Automation industries.
	WHAT: It is a Dc motor control system for accurate direction control using AVR.

	WHEN: IT is needed when easy automation is required and for precise direction control and specified applications.

	WHERE: It can be used for automation industry,  Easy monitoring at houses etc.
